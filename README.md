### Hey, I'm Dakota ðŸ‘‹

I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. I'm mainly interested in cyber security and pen testing. I enjoy playing wargames and CTFs (Capture the Flag games), and I'm working on writing up walkthroughs for some of my favorites.

I've done quite of few hand-written writeups of TryHackMe boxes, and you can find those [here](https://github.com/sdvickers98/TryHackMe-Writeups/blob/main/README.md).

I'm also working on a walkthrough of picoCTF 2019 and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sdvickers98/picoCTF-2019-Walkthrough/blob/master/README.md).

I currently work as an application security engineer at NCR Corporation, regularly conducting web application penetration tests on internally-developed software in order to improve the company's overall security posture.

I use [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) a lot for CTFs and wargames, and I'm working on a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/sdvickers98/pwntools_Tutorials/blob/master/README.md) that cover how to accomplish various attacks and techniques using this powerful Python framework.
