### Hey, I'm Dakota ðŸ‘‹

I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. I've worked in the cybersecurity industry for about 3 years (as of January 2024) with a focus on application and cloud pentesting.

A few years ago, I made quite a few hand-written writeups of TryHackMe boxes, and you can find those [here](https://github.com/sdvickers98/TryHackMe-Writeups/blob/main/README.md).

I've also got a [website](https://bufoverflow.com) where I post writeups of HackTheBox machines and other CTF-like challenges. I plan on adding more non-writeup content, like PoCs for new exploits and certification reviews. The website also has a cheatsheets section that I'm currently expanding where you can find cheatsheets and reference materials for everything from Linux commands to hacking techniques.

In relation to the cheatsheets on my website, I wrote a small (crappy) script that generates a Table of Contents for a markdown file based on the headers in the file. You can find it [here](https://github.com/sdvickers98/markdown-toc).

**sdvickers98/sdvickers98** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I use [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) a lot for CTFs and wargames, and I'm working on a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/sdvickers98/pwntools_Tutorials/blob/master/README.md) that cover how to accomplish various attacks and techniques using this powerful Python framework.
