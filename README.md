### Hey, I'm Dakota ðŸ‘‹

I study Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. I'm mainly interested in cyber security and pen testing. I enjoy playing wargames and CTFs (Capture the Flag games), and I'm working on writing up walkthroughs for some of my favorites.

I'm currently working on my first one. It's a walkthrough of picoCTF and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sdvickers98/picoCTF-2019-Walkthrough).

I use [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) a lot for CTFs and wargames, and I'm working on a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/sdvickers98/pwntools_Tutorials) that cover how to accomplish various attacks and techniques using this powerful Python framework.
